# ILD_FCCee_v02

A model of ILD for a circular collider.

- MDI taken from FCCee common MDI design
- vertex detector, inner (silicon) tracker and lumiCal copy of CLD_o2_v07
- TPC inner radius enlarged compared to ILD_l5_v02 model (329 -> 701 mm) to keep 5 mm safety distance from the outer radius of the inner tracker (696 mm)
- other subdetectors same as ILD_l5_v02 except for removed ECal ring
