# ILD_FCCee_v01

A model of ILD for a circular collider.

- MDI taken from FCCee common MDI design
- vertex detector and lumiCal copy of CLD_o2_v07
- inner silicon tracker adapted from CLD_o2_v07
- TPC inner radius slightly larger than ILD_l5_v02 model (329 -> 365 mm) to keep 150 mrad cone clear for MDI
- other subdetectors same as ILD_l5_v02 except for removed ECal ring
